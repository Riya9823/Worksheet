11. An outlier is a piece of data that is an abnormal distance from other points. In other words, it’s data that lies outside the other values in the set. 
    The Inter Quartile Range(IQR) method for outlier detection are:
    1.Calculate the interquartile range for the data.
    2.Multiply the interquartile range (IQR) by 1.5.
    3.Add 1.5 x (IQR) to the third quartile. Any number greater than this is a suspected outlier.
    4.Subtract 1.5 x (IQR) from the first quartile. Any number less than this is a suspected outlier.
Example: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7, 10, 10, 12, 13, 17, 39}
         Q1 = 3, Q3 = 12.5
         IQR = 12.5 - 3 = 9.5.
         Q1 – 1.5xIQR = 3 – 1.5(9.5)
         = 3 -14.25 = -11.25
         Anything less than -11.25 is an outlier.
12.    Bagging: Bagging technique can be an effective approach to reduce the variance of a model, to prevent over-fitting and to increase the accuracy of unstable models. 
              1.Aim to decrease variance, not bias.	
              2.Random forest.
       Boosting: Boosting enables us to implement a strong model by combining a number of weak models together.
              1.Aim to decrease bias, not variance. 
              2.Gradient boosting.
